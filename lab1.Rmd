```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

At the very beginning is an (optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`s, the header specifies useful meta data. 

Below the header is the first code chunk, this chunk sets global options that apply to every chunk in your file. This is done by calling `knitr::opts_chunk$set` in this code chunk. Note that these global defaults can be overwritten in individual chunk headers. `include = FALSE` prevents both codes and results from appearing.

To understand `echo = TRUE`, `message = FALSE` and `warning = FALSE`, read [RMarkdown tips and tricks](http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/sds291/RMarkdownTips.html). _Energetic Students: read the "Shortening knit time" section and try it in this file_

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

##  Exercise 8 from ISLR Chapter 2

The following illustrate commands for exploring this exercise using R and various packages for the `College` data.

### Libraries

Try to load the `ISLR` library
```{r}
library(ISLR)
```

If it is not available you will need to install the  library from CRAN. Click on  *Packages*  then *Install*.  Enter the package name then click on the Install button.

You can also install from the console/command line using
`install.packages("ISLR")`.

Ready?

###  Getting the College data

Next we will need to load the dataset.  This is part of the library so we will not need to read it in using `read.csv` but rather we will use the `data` function to load it from the library.

```{r data}
data(College)
```

This loads the dataframe `College`.  Note you can always see the content of any `R` object by simply typing its name.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
College
```


For information about the variables, read the text or enter
```{r}
help(College)
```

The info will appear in the `help` tab.

To see explore the data, you can use the command `View(College)`.

This will open a new tab, where you may scroll left and right to look at the rows and columns.
In the `View` you should see that the first column is the College/University name.  These can be extracted using `rownames(College)`.  Let's print out the first 5

```{r}
rownames(College)[1:5]
```



### Summary

```{r}
summary(College)
```

### Dimensions of Data

How many observations and variables are in the dataframe?


```{r dim, echo=FALSE}
d = dim(College)
d
```

Suppose we want to refer to those numbers in the text.  We can extract them using n = `r d[1]` and d = `r d[2]`.
Look at the code to see how we extracted them.   

### Scatter plot matrices

There `base` `R` version of scatter plot matrices is obtained using the `pairs` function to plot all variables versus each other.  We can use subsetting of columns of the dataframe to
look at the first 5 columns.  

```{r, fig.width=8}
pairs(College[, 1:5])
```

We can also look at this using the `ggpairs` function.
Install the library `GGally` if it is not available (and any dependent libraries) and load it.

```{r ggpairs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(College, columns= c(1,3:5, 2))
```

The last variable, `2` in this case, refers to  our response variable.

Note `ggpairs` will show its progress in your output and using warning=FALSE or message=FALSE does not suppress it. This answer on [this Stackexchange post:](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41577362/suppress-ggpairs-messages-when-generating-plot) provided the trick or `progress=F` to suppress the progress bar.

```{r ggpairs-good, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.width=8}
gp = ggpairs(College, columns= c(1,3:5, 2))
print(gp, progress=F)
```

The `ggpairs` function realizes that the variable `Private` is categorial and plots side by side histograms.  The density plots are also useful for seeing the skewness in the marginal distributions.

What other features do these plots indicate?  _(Think about assumptions for linear regression)_


### New variables

Let's create a new variable `Elite` by binning the `Top10perc` variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50 %.  We will use the library `dplyr` to illustrate some of the possible transformations and the idea of pipes, which are quite powerful once you get the hang of them!

For students who are unfamiliar with `dplyr`, read this [intro](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) first.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
College = College %>% 
  mutate(Elite = factor(Top10perc > 50)) %>%
  mutate(Elite = 
           recode(Elite, 'TRUE' = "Yes", 'FALSE'="No"))
  
```


_What is the above doing?_    Document the code here.

Compare to the base `R` code:

```{r, evaluate=FALSE}
Elite=rep("No",nrow(College))
Elite[College$Top10perc >50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(College ,Elite)
```

_How many Elite universities are there?_

```{r}
summary(College$Elite)
```

### Side by Side Boxplots

Let's plot the variable `Outstate` versus `Elite` using side-by-side boxplots.  Using `base R` we would enter

```{r, fig.width=6}
boxplot(Outstate ~ Elite, data=College, 
        ylab="Outstate", xlab="Elite")
title("Distribution of Out of State Tuition")
```


Now for the `ggplot` version:


```{r, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
my.bp <<-ggplot(data=College, aes(y= Outstate, x=Elite)) # Creates boxplots
my.bp <- my.bp + geom_boxplot() # Adds color
my.bp <- my.bp + ggtitle("Distribution of Out of State Tuition") # Adds a title
my.bp <- my.bp +  ylab("Outstate") + xlab("Elite") # Adds lables for axes
my.bp # displays the boxplots
```


### Conditional Plots

Let's look at the distribution of Out of state tuition versus Elite status for Private versun Public universities using _conditional plots_

```{r, fig.width=8}
coplot(Outstate ~ Elite | Private, data=College)
```


##  ggplot conditional plot

```{r, fig.width=6, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(College, aes(x = Elite, y = Outstate, 
                    group = Private, 
                    color = Private)) +
   geom_point() + facet_grid(.~Private) + ggtitle("Distribution of Out of State Tuition") 

```


## Next Steps

Update this document and explore the other variables thinking about the objective of predicting `Apps`.  Document what you discover thinking about models to predict `Apps`.

## Fit a linear model

Use the `lm` function as described in class to fit a linear model with `Apps` as the response variable and one of the predictors.   

```{r}
# add lm code here
# 
# mymodel = lm(Apps ~ XXX, data=College)
```


For the fitted model, produce diagnostic plots

```{r}
# add diagnostic plots here
# plot(mymodel)
```

Discuss whether the model seems appropriate in terms of assumptions.
