# Sta521 Lab1  9/3/2018

## Overview
 
In this lab 

* we will cover using RStudio on Saxon or a laptop
* demonstrate RNotebooks  (for more info see the [RStudio page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html#version_control))


For why Reproducible Research is important read [Yihui's post](https://yihui.name/en/2012/06/enjoyable-reproducible-research/)  (and watch the video in the blog about what happened at Duke when RR was not used!) or review CaseStudies from the 
(StatSci Bomputing Bootcamp)[https://github.com/DukeStatSci/computing-bootcamp-2018]

## Preliminaries

A couple things to get everyone on the same page,

1. If you don't have one, sign up for a GitHub account (it takes 1 min.)

  * Go to https://github.com/join
  * Enter your information
  * Pick the Unlimited public repositories for free. plan

Ready?


## Start R-Studio

If you have a StatSci account,   
  
   1) Clone the repository through the following link https://classroom.github.com/a/xVJBLEKW
   and accept the invitation.  This will create a repository  https://github.com/STA521-F18/lab1-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
   
    2) Open RStudio on Saxon  https://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787 and login with your Duke netid and password.
    
   3) Create a new Project.  In RStudio, click on New Project in the file menu.  Select Version Control, then Git. Enter https://github.com/STA521-F18/lab1-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git (replace with your username on github) in the  Repository URL field, provide a name for the project, e.g. 'lab1', and select a directory to save your work, e.g. Lab1    We suggest that you make a folder for STA521 to save your work for the course.
   
  4) On the lower right panel in RStudio, click on the Files tab. You should see a listing of the files in your directory. Click on `lab1.Rmd` to open it in the RStudio editor and then follow instructions there.  
  
  For more on getting started using RStudio and git see the [StatSci ComputingBootcamp slides](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/ComputingBootcamp2018/blob/master/slides/computing_bootcamp_2018.Rmd) and other materials at  [StatSci ComputingBootcamp](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/ComputingBootcamp2018/)
  
If you are unable to login to saxon in lab, please see the TA or instructor. (If you responded to the survey you should have an account)
