# Sta521 Lab1  9/3/2018

In this lab 

* we will cover using RStudio on Saxon or a laptop
* demonstrate RNotebooks  (for more info see the [RStudio page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html#version_control))


For why Reproducible Research is important read [Yihui's post](https://yihui.name/en/2012/06/enjoyable-reproducible-research/)  (and watch the video in the blog about what happened at Duke when RR was not used!)


To get started:  
   1) Open RStudio on Saxon  [http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787](http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787) and login with your Duke netid and password.
   2) Clone the repository through the following link  
   and accept the invitation.  This will create a repository  https://github.com/STA521-F18/lab1-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
   3) Create a new Project.  In RStudio, click on New Project in the file menu.  Select Version Control, then Git. Enter https://github.com/STA521-F18/lab1-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git (replace with your username on github) in the  Repository URL field, provide a name for the project, e.g. 'lab1', and select a directory to save your work, e.g. Lab1    We suggest that you make a folder for STA521 to save your work for the course.
  4) On the lower right panel in RStudio, click on the Files tab. You should see a listing of the files in your directory. Click on `lab1.Rmd` to open it in the RStudio editor and then follow instructions there.  
  
  For more on getting started using RStudio and git see the [StatSci ComputingBootcamp slides](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/ComputingBootcamp2017/blob/master/slides/computing_bootcamp_2017.Rmd) and other materials at  [StatSci ComputingBootcamp](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/ComputingBootcamp2017/)
